## **🔹 Key Features**  

### **1️⃣ Secure Video Upload & Encoding**  
✅ Supports **secure video uploads** using BunnyNet’s API.  
✅ Videos are **automatically encoded** for optimal streaming quality.  
✅ Uses **adaptive bitrate streaming**, ensuring smooth playback on all devices.  

### **2️⃣ Adaptive Streaming & Playback Management**  
✅ **Real-time streaming with BunnyNet's adaptive bitrate technology.**  
✅ Dynamic streaming adjustment based on network conditions.  
✅ Supports **multiple video resolutions (480p, 720p, 1080p)**.  

### **3️⃣ Content Monetization System**  
✅ Integrated **payment gateway** for paid access to premium videos.  
✅ Supports **one-time payments & subscription-based monetization.**  
✅ API-driven access control for managing user permissions.  

### **4️⃣ User Engagement & Analytics Tracking**  
✅ Collects **detailed video playback statistics** (views, watch time, engagement).  
✅ Real-time tracking of **user behavior, heatmaps, and retention metrics**.  
✅ Provides **admin-level insights** for content optimization.  

### **5️⃣ Secure API Architecture**  
✅ All services are implemented as **modular microservices**.  
✅ APIs are secured using **OAuth 2.0 & JWT authentication**.  
✅ Strict **CORS policies & request validation** for enhanced security.  

### **6️⃣ Fully Tested APIs**  
✅ **Functional Testing:** Ensured all API calls work as expected.  
✅ **Security Testing:** Checked for vulnerabilities like SQL Injection, XSS, and CSRF.  
✅ **Load Testing:** APIs were stress-tested to handle high traffic loads.
